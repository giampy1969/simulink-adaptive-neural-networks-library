"LGORITHM: <br>\n  This Neural Network is essentially an RBF Neural Network wi"
"th an \n  additional lateral connection structure between the neural units \n"
"  of the hidden layer. This structure is used in an attempt to mirror \n  the"
" topology of the input manifold. <br>\n  As in the RAN, the learning algorith"
"m, in order to decrease the error, \n  changes weights, positions and widths "
"of the basis functions.\n  The estimation error e(k) is accumulated locally t"
"o each neuron and \n  used to determine where (and if) to activate a new neur"
"on. <br> \n  DSC stands for Dynamic Cell Structure.<br>\n<br>\n  OUTPUT EQUAT"
"ION: <br>\nAt any given time t, if x(t) is the input vector, we indicate with"
" bmu the nearest unit (among those related to the h-th output) to the current"
" position of the input, and with sec is the nearest unit after the bmu. The n"
"eighborhood of the bmu is defined as the set of all the units that are connec"
"ted to the bmu \nby the interlayer connection matrix CN, that is all the unit"
"s i such that CN(h,t,bmu,i) > 0. \nBeing W(h,t,bmu) and W(h,t,sec) the weight"
"s associated with the bmu and the sec units, and dist(bmu,x)  and dist(sec,x)"
" their distances from the current input point x(t), if the PIECEWISE CONICAL "

":\nys(h,t)=W(h,t,bmu) if dist(sec,x)>dist(sec,bmu) \nys(h,t)=W(h,t,bmu)+b*(W("

") \n<br>\n  If the GAUSSIAN activation functions are used t, then the h-th ou"
"tput \n  of the neural network is simply: <br>\n  ys(h,t)=W(h,t)*g(x(t),S(h,t"
"),C(h,t)) <br>\n  where W(h,t) is the output weight matrix related to the h-t"
"h output, \n  g is the vector of radial basis functions of the input x(t), an"
"d\n  finally S(h,t) and C(h,t) are vectors of widths and centers \n  (relativ"
"e to the h-th output).<br>\n<br>\n  STATE EQUATION (Learning Algorithm): <br>"
"\n  Being e(h,t)=y(h,t)-ys(h,t) the h-th element of the error vector, \n  at "
"a time t, and x(t) the input vector at the same time, we indicate \n  with bm"
"u the nearest unit (among those related to the h-th output) \n  to the curren"
"t position of the input, and with sec is the nearest \n  unit after the bmu. "
"The neighborhood of the bmu is defined as the set of \n  all the units that a"
"re connected to the bmu by the interlayer connection \n  matrix CN, that is a"
"ll the units i such that CN(h,t,bmu,i) > 0. <br>\n  Firstly, the connection m"
"atrix updated, by setting to 1 the strength of \n  the connection between bmu"
" and sec, ( that is CN(h,t+1,bmu,sec)=1 and \n  CN(h,t+1,sec,bmu)=1 ), and by"
" multiplying by a value alpha < 1 the \n  strength of all the other connectio"
"ns ( that is for every i,j <> bmu,sec \n  CN(h,t+1,i,j)=CN(h,t,i,j)*alpha ). "
"Also, all the connections whose \n  strength is less than a threshold theta a"
"re deleted (i.e. their strength \n  is set to 0). This kind of updating is al"
"so called \"Hebbian Learning\". <br>\n  The next step in the network adaptati"
"on algorithm consist in moving the \n  positions of the BMU and its neighborh"
"ood toward the current input x(t), \n  following a so called \"Kohonen\" rule"
". Specifically, if C(h,t,i) is\n  the position of the neuron i, related to th"
"e output h, at time t,\n  then for each neuron i belonging to the neighborhoo"
"d of the bmu \n  we have C(h,t+1,i)=epsilon(i)*(x(t)-C(h,t,i)). <br>\n  Each "
"neuron i is associated with a value called resource, R(h,t,i) and \n  at this"
" point in the algorithm, the resource of the bmu is updated, \n  specifically"
", the resource of the bmu is set to the error e(h,t) \n  divided by the numbe"
"r of times that the unit has been selected as bmu. <br>\n  If the mean value "
"of the resource of the whole network is greater than \n  a certain threshold "
"RsThr, and if the last neuron activation was more than \n  lambda steps ago, "
"then a new neuron is activated. <br>\n  The new neuron n is placed between th"

" \"Extended Minimal Resource Allocating Network\".<br>\n<br>\n  OUTPUT EQUATI"
"ON: <br>\n  At any given time t, if x(t) is the input vector, \n  then the h-"
"th output of the neural network is : <br>\n  ys(h,t)=W(h,t)*g(x(t),S(h,t),C(h"
",t)) <br>\n  where W(h,t) is the output weight matrix related to the h-th out"
"put, \n  g is the vector of radial basis functions of the input x(t), and\n  "
"finally S(h,t) and C(h,t) are vectors of widths and centers \n  (relative to "
"the h-th output).<br>\n<br>\n  STATE EQUATION (Learning Algorithm): <br>\n  B"
"eing e(h,t)=y(h,t)-ys(h,t) the h-th element of the error vector, \n  at a tim"
"e t, a neuron is added if and only if ALL the following criteria are met: <br"
">\n  1) the error e(h,t) is greater than a threshold (E1). <br>\n  2) the dis"
"tance from the nearest neuron is greater than a threshold (E2). <br> \n  3) t"
"he filtered error ef(h,t) is greater than a threshold. <br>\n  This new neuro"
"n j is positioned at the current input point C(h,t+1,j)=x(t),\n  the width of"
" its basis function is set to S(h,t+1,j)=overlap*dist(x(t),C(h,t,nearest)),\n"
"  that is, an overlapping factor multiplied by the distance to the nearest ne"
"uron. \n  Finally, its output weight vector Wj(h,t) is initialized to e(h,t)."
"<br>\n  If at least one of the three criteria is not satisfied, then the vect"
"or X(t)\n  containing all the neural network states, (weights, widths, and ce"
"nters) \n  is updated according to the modified gradient rule: <br>\n  X(t+T)"
"=X(t)+eta*(dys/dX)*e(t)-eta*gamma*X(t) <br>\n  where eta is the learning rate"
